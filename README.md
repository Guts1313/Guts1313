###  About Me
- **Experience**: I have 2 years of professional experience working on various projects for companies accross Europe, I have worked and enjoy working in teams, regardless of the working protocol of choice - Agile / Waterfall /  I can thrive in any setting. 
-  **Recent personal project:** As of recent months I reverse-engineered and rebuilt the biggest geo-location provider in the Netherlands - Postcode.nl and the main focus of this project was building a smart autocomplete input box that would provide accurate address suggestions based on partial user input while being extremely performant whilst working with big datasets ~30m rows of data per country. This project currently is and will not be publicly available but a demo can be found downstream in this repository :)
-  **Currently specialising in:** Full-stack Python/React web development - APIs / Saas / AI Integration ...  
-  **My purpose is:** Crafting clean, efficient solutions to real-world problems both available as APIs and Web application platforms with different AI integrations. Working daily on LeetCode problems, aiming to become the best version of myself.
-  **Hobbies:** Trying to make people's lives easier through the art of coding, a huge movie fan! Kinda LOTR maniac :). LeetCode is another thing that I have been spending a lot of time on as of recent, I love being challenged in different ways.
